# Description and Use #

A customer requested a world clock that showed three
timezones and updated every second.  This clock shows three
time zones, controlled via a `data-tz` data attribute on the `.clock`
div.

The code requires the ![moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) javascript library
otherwise time code in javascript is a huge pain.
